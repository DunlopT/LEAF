# LEAF
This repository houses the Lifecycle Ecosystem Assessment Forecast (LEAF) model. This numerical tool has been developed to simulate the growth and mortality of mangroves across all lifecycle stages (seedling to senescence). This model has been developed in Python and tested via coupling with a hydro-morphodynamic model in [Delft3D Flexible Mesh (DFM)](https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3dfm). When projected at a local site, the LEAF model can be used to quantify potential restoration outcomes including forest attributes such as stem and root size, carbon storage via biomass calculations, coastal protection via drag coefficients, projected forested areas and volumes, and bed level change. The predicted outcomes of the LEAF model can be used to inform mangrove viability and to compare restoration strategies. LEAF has been developed as a user-friendly tool that can be updated with field and laboratory data to support practitioners in mangrove restoration and the design and planning of Nature-based Solutions.

LEAF forms part of the PhD research conducted by Thomas Dunlop at the [Water Research Laboratory, UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/wrl).
